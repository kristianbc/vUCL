# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, the contributors and maintainers of the vUCL project, pledge to create and maintain a welcoming and respectful environment for everyone who wishes to contribute. We value and prioritize the participation of people from all backgrounds and experiences, and we are committed to treating all contributors with respect and dignity.

## Our Standards

To ensure a positive and inclusive atmosphere, we have established the following standards for our project and its community:

### 1. Inclusivity

We welcome contributions from all individuals, regardless of age, background, culture, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, nationality, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic that makes someone unique. Discrimination or harassment in any form will not be tolerated.

### 2. Respectful and Constructive Communication

We encourage respectful and constructive communication between contributors. Disagreements or differences of opinion are expected, but they should be handled with professionalism and courtesy. Offensive language, personal attacks, or harassment will not be tolerated.

### 3. Collaboration

We value collaboration and teamwork. We believe that diverse perspectives and ideas contribute to the strength and quality of the project. We encourage cooperation and support among contributors.

### 4. Focus on the Project

Please keep discussions and interactions focused on the project's goals and objectives. Off-topic discussions, spam, or other irrelevant content should be avoided.
